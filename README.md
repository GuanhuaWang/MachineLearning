# Machine Learning
Some simple machine learning functions are implemented
## DataSet
The dataset we use is MNIST and also classic Spam dataset
## Functions that we implemented
* Logistic Regression
* Back Propagation Neural Network
* Linear Regression
* Ridge Regression
* Least Square Classification
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Decision Tree & Random Forest
* Kernel Tricks (Gaussian and Polynomial)
* Kmeans (Lloyd's algorithm)
* Priciple Component analysis (PCA) with Latent Factor Model
* MSE for joker recommendation
